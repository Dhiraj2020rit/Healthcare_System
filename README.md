# Healthcare_System
# Project Overview:
Healthcare companies like Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited need to leverage machine learning and MLOps to improve patient segmentation and understand disease progression. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning application that empowers healthcare professionals to achieve these objectives.
# Key Objectives:
# Data Collection and Preprocessing:
1.) Gather diverse datasets containing patient information, disease conditions, and historical data.<br/>
2.) Preprocess the data to clean, normalize, and prepare it for machine learning.
# Machine Learning Model:
1.) Develop a machine learning model in Python, which is capable of segmenting patients based on their disease conditions and severity.<br/>
2.) Implement MLOps best practices to facilitate model training and deployment.
# Technology
<b>Python:</b> The primary programming language for data processing, machine learning, and web development.<br/>
<b>Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch):</b> For building and training the machine learning model.<br/>
<b>Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly):</b> For generating visual insights.<br/>
